## ‚öôÔ∏è How to set up ?

To setup the bot for testing and development it's used Docker along with the command `docker compose`. This tool is recommended because it's more easy to setup the bot and his database. However, if you don't want to use Docker you still can run the bot anyway, if it's your case after read this topic you can jump to [Setup in local machine](#Setup in local machine).

To have a Telegram Bot is needed to open a chat with the Bot Father in Telegram, this bot will create a token which is needed to run you created bot. To make test payments, you should have a token from a payment provider as well. Learn more about payments int the [Telegram payment page](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments). To learn more about Bot Token read [How Do I Create a Bot?](https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot).

The two token created need to be placed in the file `.env`, create this file using the template file `.env.example` which already come with some settings filled. The created `.env` file is where you can change some settings and place private data as your tokens.

### Setup with Docker

First of all, install Docker Engine (or Docker Desktop, if you on Windows), [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

With docker installed, run the following commands to build the application and create the database schema needed:

```sh
# Build the application
docker compose build

# Run the application in background
docker compose up -d

# Use alembic to create the database structure in the MySQL database running on docker.
docker compose exec app alembic upgrade head

# Run the application again inside the terminal(it will print logs to help you identify if it's all working
docker compose down && docker compose up
```

### Setup in local machine

## üõë Disclaimer

This project is a demo, it's only for learning purposes. To be ready for production, many features need to be added.
